# HTML-and-CSS-Projects
This is for all my Tech Academy projects utilizing HTML and CSS.

## Projects
[Travel Company Website](Website_Project/index.html)

[Movie Theater Company Website](bootstrap4_project/academy_cinemas.html)

### Travel Company Website
This website is an example of a fantasy travel website where a company offers flights to faraway lands. It's inspired by a certain video game, and uses CSS for its styling. It contains a functional navbar, images with hover effects, and an form.

### Movie Theater Company Website
This website is an idea for a movie theater company's home page, where they detail the history of the company and movies that are currently being shown. I created it using Bootstrap 4 for the styling. It contains a navbar, jumbotron, form, cards, and dropdowns.
